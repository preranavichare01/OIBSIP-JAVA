# Oasis Infobyte Internship Tasks
Repository for JAVA tasks completed during Oasis Info Byte internship. Includes implementations of various programming challenges and projects focusing on Java application development.


## Task 2: Number Guessing Game

### Overview
I developed an interactive Number Guessing Game in Java with a dynamic and user-friendly graphical interface. The game allows users to guess a random number between 1 and 100, with the range dynamically adjusting based on their guesses.

### Key Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Created using `javax.swing` for an engaging user experience.
- **Dynamic Range Update:** Adjusts the guessing range after each input, providing real-time feedback.
- **User Input:** Includes a text field for entering guesses and buttons for submitting guesses and resetting the game.
- **Feedback:** Labels display whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, along with the current range.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `NumberGuessingGameUI.java` file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Task 3: ATM Interface

### Overview
I created a fully functional ATM Interface that simulates common banking transactions.

### Features
- **Deposit:** Easily add funds to your account.
- **Withdraw:** Conveniently withdraw cash.
- **Transfer:** Seamlessly transfer money to another account.
- **Transaction History:** Keep track of all transactions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-use.

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the ATM interface application.
3. Follow the prompts on the screen to perform transactions and view transaction history.
